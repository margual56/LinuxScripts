<p>A collection of useful scripts for linux.</p>

### Please check out [the Wiki pages](https://github.com/margual56/LinuxScripts/wiki). They contain most of the instructions and information.


## Fear not
All the scripts are supposed to be well documented both in the script itself and in [the Wiki](https://github.com/margual56/LinuxScripts/wiki) if needed.<br/>
These are scripts created for ourselves, we just wanted to share them


## Fork me!
Feel free to add your own scripts! Add your name at the beginning of the script and the date it was created in.

There are a few requirements tho:
 * The code must be well formatted
 * The code must be have as much comments as possible (the more, the better)
 * If any further explanation or disclaimer is needed besides the script comments, a page in the Wiki must be created
 * Check that it works!
